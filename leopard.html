      <h1>PLACES IN SRI LANKA TO SEE LEOPARDS</h1>
      <p>
        Without a doubt, Sri Lanka is the leopard's homeland. There isn't a
        predator like that in Sri Lanka to rival the leopard. While there have
        been reports of the odd altercation between a sloth bear and a wild
        boar, the leopards are mostly left alone to hunt and feed. They can be
        found in pockets of woodland, tea estates, grasslands, residential
        gardens, and plantations of pine and eucalyptus in the central hills of
        Sri Lanka. These are some places where leopards are found in Sri Lanka.

          <h1>Yala National Park</h1>
          <p>
            Yala national park is truly the land of the leopard. One of the most
            iconic sights in Yala National Park is seeing a beautiful cat
            strolling over the wide plains or perched on a rocky ledge. In Yala,
            a number of well-known leopards have become popular symbols. In Yala
            National Park, the ideal time to see leopards is during the dry
            season. When rainfall is at its lowest, which occurs from June to
            September, these secretive critters are more likely to be out and
            about and like dry weather. Currently, approximately 130 distinct
            leopards have been discovered as part of an extensive research on
            the park's leopard population. New individuals are eager to be
            identified even today, demonstrating the high density of these
            predators in a very limited region (only 142 square kilometers). The
            park has a very informative "Leopard Centre" where tourists may
            learn more about these predators.

          <h1>Wilpattu National Park</h1>
          <p>
            The largest national park in Sri Lanka, Wilpattu, is situated in the
            northwest lowlands and was formerly the most well-known spot to
            observe leopards in the country. Wilpattu has a denser population
            and a terrain dominated by dark forests, with just a few open areas
            that are often made up of naturally occurring lakes called Villus.
            These lepoards are tough to spot in the deep, dark forests, but when
            they do appear on the roadways, they are amazing to observe. The
            lakes with wide sand beaches are among the most breathtaking places
            to see these amazing meat-eating creatures

          <h1>Horton Plains</h1>

          <p>
            Nestled in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, Horton Plains
            National Park is a unique ecological gem known for its montane
            grasslands, cloud forests, and remarkable biodiversity. While
            renowned for the World's End viewpoint with its stunning 880-meter
            cliff drop, the park also hosts a population of elusive leopards.
            The leopards, although present, navigate the dense vegetation and
            rugged terrain with stealth, making sightings a thrilling yet
            challenging experience. The park's high-altitude environment,
            coupled with its scenic trails, offers a distinctive backdrop for
            wildlife enthusiasts. Visitors can embark on well-marked hiking
            paths, potentially catching glimpses of leopards against the
            backdrop of rolling hills and waterfalls. As Horton Plains National
            Park stands as a testament to Sri Lanka's natural beauty and
            ecological diversity, encountering leopards in this pristine setting
            adds an extra layer of excitement to the overall wildlife
            experience.

  <h1 id="threat-head">Threats</h1>
  <p class="threat-head">
    Leopards in Sri Lanka face severe threats including habitat loss due to
    urbanization and agriculture, human-wildlife conflict arising from livestock
    predation, and poaching driven by illegal wildlife trade. Inadequate
    conservation measures compound these challenges, emphasizing the need for
    urgent, coordinated efforts in habitat preservation, community engagement,
    and law enforcement to ensure the survival of these iconic predators.

      <h2>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        consequences : <br />Leopards may feed on cattle, which could lead local
        populations to carry out reprisals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mitigation : <br />putting into practise methods to reduce conflict
        between humans and animals, such as safe enclosures for livestock, plans
        to compensate livestock losses, and community education initiatives to
        promote harmony with nature

      <h2>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h2>
      <p>
        Consequence: <br />Reductions in the availability of prey, heightened
        conflict between humans and animals, and restricted migration for
        leopards are the results of habitat destruction and fragmentation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mitigation:<br />
        The maintenance and restoration of natural ecosystems is a common goal
        of conservation initiatives. A suitable habitat for leopards may be
        maintained by the establishment of protected areas and
        wildlife corridors.

      <h2>Road Accidents</h2>
      <p>
        Consequence:<br />
        Increased road infrastructure can lead to leopard fatalities due to
        collisions with vehicles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mitigation: <br />Implementing measures like speed limits in leopard
        habitats, constructing wildlife crossings, and raising awareness among
        drivers about the presence of wildlife on roads.
