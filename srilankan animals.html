          <h2>Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus)</h2>
          <p>
            The Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus) is a captivating
            primate species exclusively found in Sri Lanka, showcasing
            distinctive features that set it apart in the realm of wildlife. Its
            most notable characteristic is the striking purple hue adorning its
            face, contrasting sharply with its sleek black fur coat. Typically
            measuring between 42 to 61 centimeters in body length and sporting a
            tail ranging from 60 to 75 centimeters, these medium-sized Old World
            monkeys captivate observers with their unique appearance. Endemic to
            Sri Lanka, they primarily inhabit rainforests, montane forests, and
            hilly regions, often occupying the upper canopy where they feed on
            leaves, fruits, and flowers. Social animals, Purple-faced Langurs
            form groups of varying sizes, employing a range of vocalizations for
            communication. Despite their visual allure, these langurs face
            threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and hunting.
            Conservation initiatives and protected areas strive to mitigate
            these challenges and preserve the Purple-faced Langur's significance
            within Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity.

          <h2>RED SLENDER LORIS</h2>
          <p>
            Native to Sri Lanka's jungles, the red slender loris (Loris
            tardigradus) is a tiny, nocturnal strepsirrhine monkey. This species
            is ranked No. 6 out of the 10 focus species and No. 22 out of the
            100 EDGE mammal species that are thought to be the most globally
            endangered and evolutionary different worldwide. It has been
            determined that L. t. tardigradus and L. t. nycticeboides are the
            two subspecies.
